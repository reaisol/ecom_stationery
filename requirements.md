Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Paper eCommerce Platform
Version: 1.0
 Date: August 4, 2025
 Status: Draft for Review
1. Introduction & Vision
1.1 Vision
Our Paper eCommerce Platform aims to provide a comprehensive, efficient, and user-friendly online marketplace for paper products. We envision a modern, responsive web platform that serves businesses, with high-quality paper products, from basic printing paper to specialized stationery and industrial paper supplies.
1.2 Problem Statement
The paper industry lacks a dedicated, comprehensive online platform that caters to diverse customer needs. Current solutions are either too general (missing paper-specific features) or too narrow (limited product range). Our platform addresses these gaps by creating a specialized paper marketplace with intelligent product categorization, bulk ordering capabilities, and industry-specific features like GSM specifications, paper texture filters, and institutional procurement tools.
